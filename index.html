    <p class="sectionSubTag">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3. Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag">Open schooling is refers to a system of education that allows individuals to pursue their education through flexible and open learning methods. It is primarily targeted at students who are unable to attend regular schools due to various reasons such as work commitments, financial constraints, or other personal circumstances.The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) is the largest open schooling system in India. It operates under the aegis of the Ministry of Education, Government of India. NIOS offers various academic and vocational courses at the secondary (10th) and senior secondary (12th) levels. It follows a learner-centric approach and provides education through open and distance learning methods.
